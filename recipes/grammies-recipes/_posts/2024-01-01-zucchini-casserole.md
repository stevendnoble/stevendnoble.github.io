## Ingredients

* 2-3 zucchinis, thinly sliced
* 3 chopped tomatoes
* 2 tbsp chopped onions
* 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 2 tbsp oil

## Instructions

1. **Get the Oven Ready:** Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. **Prepare the Veggies:** In a skillet, sauté the onions, zucchini, and tomatoes in oil over low heat until tender.

3. **Mix in the Good Stuff:** Transfer the sautéed vegetables into a casserole dish and evenly sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese on top.

4. **Bake the Casserole:** Place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.

5. **Serve:** This Zucchini Casserole is a testament to how a few simple ingredients can create a dish bursting with flavor and texture. Whether served as a main for vegetarians or a side for meat lovers, it brings a cheesy, vegetable-packed punch to your dining table.

## Creative Variations

* **Herb Infusion:** Add a layer of complexity by incorporating fresh herbs such as basil, oregano, or thyme into the vegetable sauté. These herbs will infuse the casserole with aromatic flavors, complementing the zucchini and tomato beautifully.
* **Crunchy Topping:** For a bit of texture, consider adding a breadcrumb and parmesan mixture on top before baking. The breadcrumbs will toast to a golden brown, offering a satisfying crunch with each forkful.
* **Mix in Proteins:** To transform this casserole into a hearty main course, add cooked chicken, ground turkey, or even crumbled tofu to the vegetable mix. These proteins will make the dish more filling and provide an excellent source of additional nutrients.

## Serving Suggestions

* **Side Dish Excellence:** Serve this casserole alongside grilled meats or fish for a complete meal that's both balanced and flavorful. Its cheesy, vegetable-rich profile makes it an excellent companion to lighter main courses.
