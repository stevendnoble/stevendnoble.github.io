Transform the classic holiday mincemeat into a delectable, easy-to-serve dessert with this Mincemeat Squares recipe. These squares combine the rich, spiced flavors of traditional mincemeat with the crumbly, buttery texture of a baked oat crust, creating a perfect balance of taste and texture. Ideal for holiday gatherings, potlucks, or simply as a warm treat on a chilly evening, this recipe is a must-try for those who love to explore the depth of holiday flavors in new forms.

## Ingredients

* ¾ cup shortening
* 1 cup brown sugar
* ½ tsp salt
* 1½ cups flour
* 1¼ cups rolled oats
* 2 cups mincemeat

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough:** In a mixing bowl, thoroughly cream together the shortening and brown sugar. This will form the base of your crumbly crust and topping.

2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** Sift together the flour and salt, then stir these into your creamed mixture. This will ensure your squares have the perfect texture.

3. **Add Oats:** Mix in the rolled oats until the dough is well combined. The oats add a delightful chewiness and depth to the crust.

4. **Layer the Pan:** Press half of the oat mixture into a greased and floured 8x8 inch baking pan, creating a firm base for your squares.

5. **Add the Filling:** Spread the cooled mincemeat filling evenly over the base, then sprinkle the remaining oat mixture on top, patting down lightly to secure.

6. **Bake:** Place in a preheated oven at 400°F for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly.

7. **Serving Suggestions:** Cut into squares while still warm for easier serving. Enjoy these mincemeat squares on their own, or pair with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.

## A Culinary Journey Through Time: The Evolution of Mincemeat

Mincemeat, traditionally a mixture of chopped dried fruit, distilled spirits and spices, and sometimes beef or venison, dates back to the 15th century. Originally, it was a way to preserve food. Over time, the recipe evolved, becoming sweeter and more associated with desserts and holiday celebrations. Our Mincemeat Squares recipe pays homage to this rich history, offering a modern, accessible way to enjoy the complex flavors of mincemeat without the need for a pie crust or meat.

### Customizing Your Mincemeat Squares

The beauty of Mincemeat Squares lies in their versatility. Here are a few suggestions to make the recipe your own:

* **Fruit Variations:** While traditional mincemeat is rich in raisins and currants, feel free to incorporate other dried fruits such as chopped dates, figs, or even cranberries for a tart twist.
* **Nutty Additions:** For added texture and flavor, consider stirring in chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds into the oat mixture.
* **Spice It Up:** Enhance the filling with additional spices such as allspice, cardamom, or a splash of brandy or rum for a deeper flavor profile.

### Baking Tips for Perfect Mincemeat Squares

Achieving the perfect balance of a crumbly yet cohesive crust with a richly flavored filling is key to creating memorable Mincemeat Squares. Keep these tips in mind:

* **Chill the Dough:** If the oat mixture is too crumbly to work with, chilling it for 30 minutes before pressing into the pan can make it more manageable.
* **Even Layers:** Ensure that the bottom layer of the oat mixture is firmly pressed into the pan to create a stable base, and strive for an even layer of mincemeat filling to ensure every bite is full of flavor.
* **Cool Completely:** Allow the baked squares to cool completely in the pan before cutting into them. This patience will be rewarded with cleaner cuts and a more set filling.
