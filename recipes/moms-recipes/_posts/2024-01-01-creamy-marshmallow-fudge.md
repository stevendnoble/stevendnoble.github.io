* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

3. **Combine:** Remove the saucepan from heat. Beat in the butter, chocolate pieces, and vanilla extract until the chocolate has fully melted and the mixture is smooth.

4. **Mold:** Pour the fudge into a buttered 9-inch square pan and spread evenly.

5. **Serve:** Chill in the refrigerator until the fudge is hard. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

## Delving Deeper into Creamy Marshmallow Fudge

Creamy Marshmallow Fudge is more than just a treat; it's a journey into the heart of comfort food, combining the rich, complex flavors of chocolate with the light, sweet airiness of marshmallows.

Whether you're preparing for a festive occasion or simply seeking to add a touch of sweetness to your day, this fudge recipe offers a perfect blend of indulgence and simplicity.

## Creative Twists on a Classic Recipe

* **Flavor Infusions:** Experiment with adding different extracts like peppermint, almond, or orange to introduce new dimensions to your fudge. A few drops can transform the flavor profile and make each batch uniquely delicious.
* **Mix-Ins and Toppings:** Consider stirring in your favorite mix-ins such as crushed cookies, candies, or even a swirl of caramel or peanut butter before the fudge sets. Sprinkling sea salt, toasted coconut, or crushed nuts on top can add texture and contrast to the creamy fudge.
* **Layered Delights:** For an impressive presentation, create layered fudge by dividing the batch and adding food coloring or different flavors to each layer. Alternating between dark chocolate and white chocolate layers can also offer a stunning visual and taste experience.

## Serving and Storage Tips

Creamy Marshmallow Fudge is best enjoyed at room temperature, where its textures and flavors are most pronounced. However, storing it in the refrigerator in an airtight container can extend its shelf life, allowing you to savor this treat for up to two weeks. When ready to serve, let the fudge sit out for a few minutes to soften slightly, ensuring the best possible taste experience.
