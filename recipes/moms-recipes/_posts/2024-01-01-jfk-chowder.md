In the heart of every New England kitchen lies the soul of comfort food: the chowder. The JFK Chowder, named after one of America's most iconic presidents, John F. Kennedy, is a testament to the timeless appeal of this beloved dish. This recipe offers a nod to JFK's New England roots, presenting a hearty, warming chowder that combines the ocean's bounty with the earth's harvest.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds haddock, deboned
* 3 cups water
* 2 ounces salt pork, diced
* 2 onions, sliced
* 4 large potatoes, diced
* 1 cup celery, chopped
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp salt
* Ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 quart of milk
* 2 tbsp butter

## Instructions

1. **Boil the Broth:** In a soup pot over medium heat, simmer the haddock in 2 cups of water for 15 minutes. Drain, reserving both the broth and the fish.

2. **Prep the Pork:** Sauté the diced salt pork in the same pot until crisp. Remove and set aside, keeping the fat in the pot.

3. **Flavor the Fat:** In the pork fat, sauté onions until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

4. **Integrate the Ingredients:** Add back the reserved fish, diced potatoes, chopped celery, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Pour in the reserved fish broth and the remaining cup of water.

5. **Simmer the Soup:** Over low heat until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf afterward.

6. **Dial Up the Dairy:** Stir in the milk and butter, simmering for an additional 5 minutes.
Serve the Stew: Serve hot, garnished with the crispy salt pork.
