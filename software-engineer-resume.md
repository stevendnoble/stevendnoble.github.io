  As a Software Engineer on the Growth team at Upstart, I apply my skills and knowledge in Ruby on
  Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices, and A/B Testing to improve the user experience
  and conversion rate of our online lending platform. I have been working at Upstart for four years,
  and I enjoy being part of a mission-driven, innovative, and collaborative team that is transforming
  the credit industry with AI and data science. Before joining Upstart, I was a Software Engineer at
  Snapdocs, where I built back-end solutions for connecting our notary scheduling app and our digital
  closing solution for lenders and designed and implemented a microservice for storing eNotes. I also
  have two years of experience as an Outcomes Instructor at General Assembly, where I taught
  algorithms and interview prep to recent graduates of the web development boot camp. My background
  in mathematics and special education has given me a unique perspective and a strong foundation in
  problem-solving, communication, and mentorship. I am passionate about creating software that is
  accessible, user-friendly, and impactful.
