Mincemeat Pie stands as a testament to the rich, complex flavors of the holiday season. This classic recipe weaves together the sweet, spiced notes of traditional mincemeat with the buttery crispness of a homemade pie crust, topped with a beautifully arranged lattice that's as pleasing to the eye as it is to the palate. Whether you're continuing a family tradition or starting a new one, this Mincemeat Pie is sure to fill your home with the aroma of holiday cheer.

## Ingredients

* Your favorite pie crust recipe (enough for a bottom and a lattice top)
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten (for egg wash)
* 2 tsp sugar (for sprinkling)
* 4 cups prepared mincemeat

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Oven:** Place a baking sheet in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F. This will help catch any drips and ensure the bottom crust cooks evenly.

2. **Form the Pie Shell:** Roll out half of your pie dough and gently press it into a 9-inch pie dish. Make sure it's evenly spread and reaches the edges of the dish.

3. **Fill the Pie:** Stir the mincemeat to ensure it's evenly mixed, then spoon it into the prepared pie shell, spreading it evenly.

4. **Create the Lattice Top:** Roll out the remaining dough and cut into 1-inch strips. Arrange these strips in a lattice pattern over the filling. Trim any excess dough from the edges and crimp to seal.

5. **Apply Egg Wash and Sugar:** Brush the lattice top with the lightly beaten egg and sprinkle evenly with 2 tsp of sugar. This will give the crust a beautiful golden sheen and a sweet crunch.

6. **Bake:** Place the pie in the preheated oven on the baking sheet. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the lattice is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

7. **Serving and Storage:** Serve the Mincemeat Pie warm or at room temperature, ideally with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
