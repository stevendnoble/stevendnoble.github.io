Dive into the world of effortless cooking with this Dump and Bake Chicken Parmesan recipe, a hassle-free way to enjoy a classic Italian dish with minimal prep and maximum flavor. This one-dish wonder combines tender chicken, penne pasta, and a rich tomato sauce under a bubbly, golden crust of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, all baked to perfection. It's the perfect solution for busy weeknights, offering a comforting, hearty meal that the whole family will love without spending hours in the kitchen.

## Ingredients

* 1 (12-ounce) package penne pasta
* 1 (24-ounce) jar pasta sauce
* 2 cups water, plus more as needed
* 1 pound chicken, boneless, skinless, and cut into small pieces
* 2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, shredded
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prep:** Preheat the oven to 425°F and spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

2. **Combine:** Dump the penne, pasta sauce, water, chicken, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese into the prepared baking dish. Season with salt and pepper, then stir to ensure the ingredients are well mixed and covered in liquid. Add more water if necessary to cover the pasta and chicken.

3. **Bake:** Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Then, uncover and continue baking until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, about 10 minutes more.

4. **Top and Finish:** Sprinkle the breadcrumbs, remaining mozzarella, and parmesan cheese over the bake. Return to the oven until the cheese melts and the breadcrumbs turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. For a crispier top, broil for an additional 5 minutes or until the desired color is achieved.
