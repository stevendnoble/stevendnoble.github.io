## Ingredients

* 1 pint creamed corn
* 3 tbsp sugar
* ¼ cup flour
* A pinch of salt
* 2 eggs, well beaten
* 1½ cups milk
* 2 tbsp butter, melted

## Instructions

1. **Get the Oven Ready:** Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. **Prepare the Corn:** In a 2-quart casserole dish, place the creamed corn. Add sugar, flour, and a pinch of salt, mixing well to combine.

3. **Mix in the Good Stuff:** Stir in the well-beaten eggs, milk, and melted butter until the mixture is homogenous.

4. **Bake the Casserole:** Place in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the casserole sets and the top is lightly golden.

## Elevate Your Casserole

Consider adding a crunchy topping for texture contrast, such as crushed crackers mixed with melted butter, sprinkled over the top before baking. For those who love a bit of heat, a diced jalapeño or a dash of cayenne pepper can add a welcome kick. Incorporating cheese, such as a sharp cheddar or Parmesan, into the mixture before baking introduces a savory depth that complements the sweetness of the corn beautifully.
