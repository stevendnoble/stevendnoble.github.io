## Ingredients

* 6 English muffins or 24 slices of French bread
* 1 (5oz) jar of sharp pasteurized cheese spread
* 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp dry mustard
* 6 tbsp margarine or butter, softened
* 2 tbsp mayonnaise
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 (6oz) can of crabmeat, drained

## Instructions

1. **Prep:** Broil the back side of the English muffins or French bread slices until lightly toasted. Allow to cool, then turn over.

2. **Mix:** Combine cheese spread, flour, dry mustard, margarine, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and minced garlic in a bowl until well blended. Gently stir in the drained crabmeat.

3. **Freeze:** Spread the crab mixture on the toasted muffins or bread slices. Freeze for at least 30 minutes to firm up.

## Pairing Suggestions for an Unforgettable Start

To complement the savory richness of Deviled Crab Puffs, consider serving them alongside a crisp, dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a sparkling Prosecco. The acidity and effervescence of these wines cut through the creaminess of the dip, creating a harmonious balance. For non-alcoholic options, a tart lemonade or a crisp, sparkling water adorned with fresh lemon or lime slices can offer a refreshing contrast.

## A Canvas for Culinary Creativity

While the base recipe for Deviled Crab Puffs is delectably straightforward, it also provides a canvas for culinary creativity. Experiment with adding a dash of Old Bay seasoning for a Maryland twist, or incorporate a spoonful of finely chopped red bell pepper for color and sweetness. For those who enjoy a bit of heat, a finely minced jalape√±o or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes can add a delightful kick that complements the crab's sweetness.
