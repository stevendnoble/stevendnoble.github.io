Consider adding a crunchy topping for texture contrast, such as crushed crackers mixed with melted butter, sprinkled over the top before baking. For those who love a bit of heat, a diced jalapeño or a dash of cayenne pepper can add a welcome kick. Incorporating cheese, such as a sharp cheddar or Parmesan, into the mixture before baking introduces a savory depth that complements the sweetness of the corn beautifully.
