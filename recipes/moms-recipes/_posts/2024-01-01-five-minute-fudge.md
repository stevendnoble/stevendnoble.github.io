* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup chopped nuts

## Instructions

3. **Mix:** Add in the chocolate chips, continuing to stir until fully melted and integrated into the mixture.

4. **Stir:** Remove from heat; stir in marshmallows, vanilla extract, and chopped nuts until the marshmallows are completely melted and the mixture is smooth.

## Perfecting Five Minute Fudge: A Sweet Delight in No Time

Creating the perfect Five Minute Fudge is an art that combines simplicity with a touch of sweetness, making it an ideal recipe for those last-minute dessert cravings or unexpected guests. This no-fuss recipe ensures that you can enjoy a decadent treat without spending hours in the kitchen, making it a favorite among both novice cooks and seasoned chefs alike. Here are some tips and variations to elevate your fudge-making experience:

* **Customize Your Nuts:** While the recipe calls for chopped nuts, feel free to experiment with different types such as walnuts, pecans, or almonds to find your preferred texture and taste. Toasting the nuts before adding them to the mixture can also enhance their flavor.
* **Flavor Variations:** Add a new dimension to your fudge by incorporating flavor extracts such as almond, peppermint, or orange. A small amount goes a long way in adding a unique twist to the classic recipe.
* **Chocolate Choices:** While milk chocolate chips are a classic choice, don't hesitate to experiment with dark chocolate or white chocolate chips for a different taste profile. You can also mix chocolate types for a more complex flavor.
* **Marshmallow Magic:** For an even smoother texture, consider using marshmallow cream instead of large marshmallows. This can make the mixing process easier and ensure a more consistent texture throughout the fudge.
* **Serving Suggestions:** Cut your fudge into creative shapes using cookie cutters for a festive touch, or layer it with other sweets like brownies or cookie dough for a decadent dessert bar.
