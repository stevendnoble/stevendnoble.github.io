Who can resist the creamy, cheesy goodness of a classic Baked Mac and Cheese? It's the ultimate comfort food that brings warmth and joy with every bite. Whether you're craving a cozy meal on a chilly evening or looking to impress at your next potluck, this recipe is sure to be a hit. And with options to add bacon, ham, or extra cheese, you can customize it to your heart's content. Let's dive into the cheesy deliciousness!

## Ingredients

* 8 oz elbow macaroni
* 3 tbsp butter
* 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 2½ cups milk
* ½ tsp salt
* ⅛ tsp ground black pepper
* ¼ cup onion, minced
* 2 cups (8 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
* ½ cup bread crumbs (optional)
* Additional shredded cheese for topping (optional)
* Bacon crumbles or chunks of ham (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Pasta Preparation:** Begin by cooking the elbow macaroni according to the package directions. Once cooked, drain and set aside. This is the base of our dish, so make sure it's perfectly al dente!

2. **Preheat the Oven:** Get your oven warmed up to 350ºF, setting the stage for the magic to happen.

3. **Make the Roux:** In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to form a roux, which will thicken our sauce to that creamy perfection.

4. **Create the Cheese Sauce:** Gradually stir in the milk, continuously stirring over medium heat until the sauce thickens. Now, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, minced onion, and, of course, the shredded cheddar cheese. Keep stirring until the cheese has completely melted into a smooth sauce.

5. **Combine:** Mix the cheese sauce with the cooked pasta, making sure every piece is coated in cheesy goodness. If you're feeling adventurous, this is the time to stir in those optional bacon crumbles or ham chunks for an extra layer of flavor.

6. **Bake:** Spoon your mac and cheese into a greased 2-quart baking dish. If you're a fan of a crunchy topping, sprinkle bread crumbs or an extra layer of shredded cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.

7. **Serve and Enjoy:** Let it cool for a few minutes before serving, then dive into the creamy, cheesy bliss that awaits.

## Personalizing Your Dish

One of the joys of Baked Mac and Cheese is its versatility. Here are a few ideas to make this dish your own:

* **Cheese Variations:** While cheddar is classic, don't hesitate to mix in other cheeses like Gruyère, Monterey Jack, or smoked gouda for added depth and flavor.
* **Add-Ins:** Elevate your dish with add-ins such as sautéed mushrooms, roasted red peppers, or spinach to sneak in some veggies.
* **Protein Boost:** For a heartier meal, incorporate cooked chicken, crispy bacon, or even lobster chunks for a luxurious twist.

## Perfect Pairings

What you serve with your Baked Mac and Cheese can transform it from a simple side to the star of a sumptuous feast. Consider these pairings for your next meal:

* **Crisp Green Salad:** Balance the richness of the mac and cheese with a light, vibrant salad dressed in a zesty vinaigrette.
* **Roasted Vegetables:** Roasted brussels sprouts, carrots, or asparagus offer a delightful contrast in textures and flavors.
* **Garlic Bread:** A side of garlic bread is perfect for mopping up any leftover cheese sauce, ensuring not a drop goes to waste.
