    As a Software Engineer on the Growth at Upstart, I apply my skills and knowledge in Ruby on Rails,
    JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices, and A/B Testing to improve the user experience
    and conversion rate of our online lending platform. I have been working at Upstart for four
    years, and I enjoy being part of a mission-driven, innovative, and collaborative team that
    is transforming the credit industry with AI and data science.

    Before joining Upstart, I was a Software Engineer at Snapdocs, where I built back-end
    solutions for connecting our notary scheduling app and our digital closing solution for
    lenders and designed and implemented a microservice for storing eNotes. I also have two years
    of experience as an Outcomes Instructor at General Assembly, where I taught algorithms and
    interview prep to recent graduates of the web development boot camp. My background in
    mathematics and special education has given me a unique perspective and a strong foundation
    in problem-solving, communication, and mentorship. I am passionate about creating software
    that is accessible, user-friendly, and impactful.

    Welcome to my culinary corner, a place where the legacy of my grandmother Elsie's
    farm-to-table cooking meets the practicality of my mother Linda's culinary approach,
    creating a unique blend of tradition and pragmatism in my approach to food. Growing
    up surrounded by the wholesome, home-grown ingredients from Elsie's farm, I learned
    the value of fresh, healthy produce and the magic it brings to even the simplest of
    dishes. My mother Linda's practical tastes in food taught me the importance of creating
    nourishing, straightforward meals that are both comforting and easy to prepare. This
    fusion of influences has ignited my love for Asian and Mediterranean cuisines, where
    the emphasis on fresh, vibrant ingredients and the art of balancing flavors aligns with
    my culinary ethos. Join me on this flavorful journey, where we'll explore recipes that
    celebrate the best of both worlds: the wholesome goodness of farm-fresh cooking and
    the exciting diversity of global cuisines.
