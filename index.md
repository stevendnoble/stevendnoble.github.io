I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for simplifying the complex - especially in the
fintech world. Currently, I'm weaving my coding magic at Upstart, using AI and data
science to change the game in the credit industry. It's an adventure I've been on for
the past four years, alongside a team that's as gung-ho about making a difference as I
am.

My journey didn't start here, though. Back at Snapdocs, I was piecing together backend
puzzles to smooth out the bumps between notaries and lenders. And before diving into the
world of fintech, I was over at General Assembly, lighting bulbs in the heads of
aspiring coders. It turns out, my journey through mathematics and special education
wasn't just a path, but a toolkit for tackling challenges and empowering others.

But hey, life isn't all about work, right? When I'm not coding, you can find me
globe-trotting to places unknown, conjuring up some exotic soap in my kitchen (lavender
and charcoal, anyone?), or diving into the latest video game saga. These hobbies keep me
balanced, inspired, and ever-curious about the world's vast tapestry.

I believe in the power of technology to connect and uplift, crafting software that's as
empathetic as it is intelligent. If you're into making meaningful tech, swapping travel
tales, or discussing the merits of artisan soap over a game session, let's chat. Who
knows what we can create together?
