    As a Software Engineer with a rich background spanning over six years, including roles at
    Upstart, Snapdocs, and as an Outcomes Instructor at General Assembly, I've developed a deep
    passion for creating accessible, user-friendly, and impactful software. At Upstart, I apply
    my expertise in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices, and A/B Testing
    to enhance user experiences and conversion rates, contributing to the company's mission to
    revolutionize the credit industry with AI and data science. My previous work at Snapdocs
    involved developing back-end solutions to integrate our notary scheduling and digital
    closing solutions, alongside designing a microservice for eNote storage. With a foundation
    in mathematics and special education, my approach to software engineering is enriched by a
    strong emphasis on problem-solving, communication, and mentorship. Through "Web Development
    Fundamentals," I aim to share insights from my journey, hoping to inspire and equip both
    aspiring developers and seasoned engineers with the knowledge to navigate the dynamic field
    of web development.

    Welcome to my culinary corner, a place where the legacy of my grandmother Elsie's
    farm-to-table cooking meets the practicality of my mother Linda's culinary approach,
    creating a unique blend of tradition and pragmatism in my approach to food. Growing
    up surrounded by the wholesome, home-grown ingredients from Elsie's farm, I learned
    the value of fresh, healthy produce and the magic it brings to even the simplest of
    dishes. My mother Linda's practical tastes in food taught me the importance of creating
    nourishing, straightforward meals that are both comforting and easy to prepare. This
    fusion of influences has ignited my love for Asian and Mediterranean cuisines, where
    the emphasis on fresh, vibrant ingredients and the art of balancing flavors aligns with
    my culinary ethos. Join me on this flavorful journey, where we'll explore recipes that
    celebrate the best of both worlds: the wholesome goodness of farm-fresh cooking and
    the exciting diversity of global cuisines.
