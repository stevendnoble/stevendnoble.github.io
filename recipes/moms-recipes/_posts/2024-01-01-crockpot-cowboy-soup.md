## Ingredients

* 2 pounds of ground meat

* 1 can of diced tomatoes
* 1 can cut green beans without draining

2. **Combine:** Place the cooked meat and cubed potatoes in a large slow cooker.

3. **Mix:** Add all the canned vegetables, tomato soup, and diced tomatoes to the slow cooker. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar. If substituting with fresh or frozen vegetables, consider adding some meat broth for extra flavor.
