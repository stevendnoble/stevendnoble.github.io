## Tips for Serving Crab Rangoon Dip

To make the most of this decadent dip, consider serving it with an array of dippers. Crispy wonton chips, toasted baguette slices, or even a variety of fresh vegetables like cucumber rounds and carrot sticks can provide the perfect crunchy contrast to the dip's creamy texture. For an extra touch of elegance, garnish the dip with additional chopped green onions or a sprinkle of paprika before serving, adding color and enhancing its visual appeal.
