# Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins

## The Magic of Gluten-Free Baking

Baking without gluten doesn't mean you have to sacrifice taste or texture. The key lies in choosing the right blend of gluten-free flours and other ingredients that mimic the structure that gluten typically provides. For these muffins, a combination of gluten-free all-purpose flour and almond flour creates a perfect, tender crumb, while xanthan gum (often included in gluten-free flour blends) helps to bind the ingredients, ensuring your muffins don't crumble apart.

## Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffin Tips

* **Avoid Overmixing:** To keep your muffins light and fluffy, mix the batter until just combined. Overmixing can lead to dense muffins.
* **Fresh vs. Frozen Berries:** Both work beautifully in this recipe. If using frozen, there’s no need to thaw them first, but remember they might slightly increase the baking time.
* **Storing Your Muffins:** These muffins keep well in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.
