As the leaves turn and the air gets crisper, nothing says comfort quite like the scent of a freshly baked Applesauce Cake wafting through your home. This recipe is a treasure trove of flavors, blending spices, sweetness, and the wholesome goodness of applesauce into a moist, delightful cake that's as perfect for a cozy afternoon snack as it is for a festive gathering. Let's dive into this heartwarming recipe that promises to be a crowd-pleaser.

## Ingredients You'll Need

* ½ cup shortening
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp mixed spice or cinnamon
* ¼ tsp powdered cloves
* 1 cup seedless chopped raisins
* 1 cup walnuts, chopped
* 1 cup sweetened applesauce

## Baking Your Applesauce Cake

1. **Prep the Shortening:** Begin by working the shortening with the back of a spoon until it's fluffy and creamy. This process ensures that your cake has a light and tender crumb.

2. **Mix in Sugar and Egg:** Gradually add the granulated sugar to the shortening, continuing to work the mixture until it's light. Then, stir in the beaten egg until everything is well combined.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** Sift together the all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda, mixed spice (or cinnamon), and powdered cloves. Then, fold in the chopped raisins and walnuts, ensuring they are evenly coated with the flour mixture. This not only adds flavor but also texture to your cake.

4. **Blend with Applesauce:** Heat the applesauce to boiling and then, alternating between the dry mixture and the applesauce, gradually add them to the sugar mixture. This step is crucial for creating the moist, dense texture that makes this cake so irresistible.

5. **Bake to Perfection:** Pour the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan (9" x 5" x 3"). Then, bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

6. **Cool and Serve:** Allow the cake to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. This cake tastes even better the next day, as the flavors have time to meld together.

## Baking Tips for the Perfect Applesauce Cake

* **Choice of Applesauce:** While any applesauce can bring this cake to life, opting for a homemade or unsweetened variety can enhance the natural apple flavor without adding extra sugar.

* **Spice it Up:** The recipe calls for cinnamon, but don't hesitate to experiment with your spice blend. A pinch of allspice, clove, or even cardamom can add depth and warmth to the cake.

* **Moisture is Key:** Applesauce cakes are prized for their moistness. To ensure your cake stays beautifully moist, avoid overbaking by checking for doneness a few minutes before the recipe suggests.
