  summary: >
    As a Software Engineer on the Growth team at Upstart, I apply my skills
    and knowledge in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis,
    Microservices, and A/B Testing to improve the user experience and
    conversion rate of our online lending platform. I have been working at
    Upstart for four years, and I enjoy being part of a mission-driven,
    innovative, and collaborative team that is transforming the credit
    industry with AI and data science.

    Before joining Upstart, I was a Software Engineer at Snapdocs, where I
    built back-end solutions for connecting our notary scheduling app and
    our digital closing solution for lenders and designed and implemented
    a microservice for storing eNotes. I also have two years of experience
    as an Outcomes Instructor at General Assembly, where I taught algorithms
    and interview prep to recent graduates of the web development boot camp.
    My background in mathematics and special education has given me a unique
    perspective and a strong foundation in problem-solving, communication,
    and mentorship. I am passionate about creating software that is
    accessible, user-friendly, and impactful.
