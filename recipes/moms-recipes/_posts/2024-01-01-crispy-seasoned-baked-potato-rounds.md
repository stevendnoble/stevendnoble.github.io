Elevate your side dish game with these Crispy Seasoned Baked Potato Rounds, a recipe that combines the comforting taste of potatoes with a perfect blend of spices. This dish is not only easy to prepare but also brings a burst of flavor to your dinner table, making it a surefire hit for any meal. Whether you're looking for a new favorite snack or a complementary side, these potato rounds, with their crispy edges and tender centers, promise to deliver satisfaction in every bite.

## Ingredients

* 2-3 medium potatoes
* 2 tbsp of olive oil or avocado oil
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tbsp paprika
* ½ tsp onion powder
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preheat and Prep:** Start by preheating your oven to 400°F. Thinly slice your potatoes into rounds. A mandolin is perfect for this step to ensure even slices for uniform cooking.

2. **Season:** In a bowl, toss the potato slices with olive oil and all the spices until each slice is well coated. This ensures that every bite is packed with flavor.

3. **Bake:** Arrange the seasoned potato rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. Bake for 15 minutes, then flip the rounds and bake for another 15 minutes to achieve that golden, crispy perfection.

4. **Crisp:** For an extra crunch, broil the potato rounds for a few seconds after baking. Watch them closely to avoid burning.

## The Versatility of Crispy Seasoned Baked Potato Rounds

Crispy Seasoned Baked Potato Rounds aren't just a side dish; they're a canvas for culinary creativity. Their simplicity belies their versatility, making them a perfect base for a variety of toppings and serving options. Imagine them topped with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chives, or loaded with melted cheese, crispy bacon bits, and a sprinkle of green onions for a take on loaded baked potatoes. They can easily transition from a casual snack during game night to an elegant side at a dinner party.

## Elevating Your Meals with a Simple Twist

The secret to these potato rounds lies in the blend of spices. The combination of garlic powder, cumin, and paprika not only adds depth to the flavor profile but also introduces a warm, earthy aroma that complements the natural sweetness of the potatoes. Experimenting with different spices can tailor the rounds to accompany any cuisine, from a smoky chipotle powder for a Mexican night to a sprinkle of Italian herbs for a Mediterranean twist.

## A Healthy Alternative

Opting for baking instead of frying, these potato rounds offer a healthier alternative to traditional potato dishes. The use of olive or avocado oil not only helps in achieving that desirable crispness but also incorporates healthy fats into your diet. Paired with the high dietary fiber content of potatoes, this dish supports a balanced diet without sacrificing taste or texture.

## Crispy Seasoned Baked Potato Rounds: A Simple Delight

These Crispy Seasoned Baked Potato Rounds are a testament to the beauty of simplicity in cooking, proving that a few well-chosen ingredients can transform the humble potato into a dish that's anything but ordinary. Serve them hot for a snack that's irresistibly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and wonderfully flavorful throughout. Enjoy the blend of spices that will make these potato rounds a much-requested favorite in your home.
