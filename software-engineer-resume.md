  As a Software Engineer on the Growth team at Upstart, I apply my skills and knowledge
  in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices, and A/B Testing to
  improve the user experience and conversion rate of our online lending platform. I have
  been working at Upstart for four years, and I enjoy being part of a mission-driven,
  innovative, and collaborative team that is transforming the credit industry with AI
  and data science. Before joining Upstart, I was a Software Engineer at Snapdocs, where
  I built back-end solutions for connecting our notary scheduling app and our digital
  closing solution for lenders and designed and implemented a microservice for storing
  eNotes. I also have two years of experience as an Outcomes Instructor at General
  Assembly, where I taught algorithms and interview prep to recent graduates of the web
  development boot camp. My background in mathematics and special education has given me
  a unique perspective and a strong foundation in problem-solving, communication, and
  mentorship. I am passionate about creating software that is accessible, user-friendly,
  and impactful.
